# Now that we have a FormHelper instance, how can we use it to customize the form? There are lots of attributes to set, and you can find them all at the FormHelper documentation. Some of the more common ones that youâ€™d use are:
# - form_method: Set the form method, GET or POST. It defaults to POST. If set to POST, then the crispy template tag will automatically render the CSRF token in the form.
# - form_action: If you want the form to submit to a different page than the one on which it was loaded, you can set the URL, path, or URL name to this attribute.
# - form_id: The value to set as the id attribute of the <form> tag.
# - form_class: The value to set as the class attribute of the <form> tag.
# - attrs: A dictionary of attributes to set on the <form> tag.        
# 
# The FormHelper can also be used to change the layout your form, for example, by wrapping your fields in fields sets or other holder tags, or to add accessory fields (like icons) to inputs. We won't be looking at these extra layout options, but if you think they'd be useful at customizing the layout of your form, you can check out the layout documentation.
